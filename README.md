### CI-Pipeline With GitHub Using Jenkins

## CI/CD & Jenkins

## How have you use Jenkins to add Continuous integration with this project?

I have built a test environment in Jenkins that will run the tests and catch any errors with the code and if everything is fine it will be pushed to
the branch that is specified in the Jenkins configuration.

## How did you allow Jenkins access to the Github repo?

In the Jenkins configuration I ticked the Github project box and pasted the Github Url of where i want the changes to be pushed (currently test-brach but will change to main later)

## How did you get the Github repo to trigger the build?

Using the private ssh key generated by using the command "Ssh-keygen -t rsa" and had to add it to Github,
Added a GitHub webhook with the Jenkins url that was triggered when a push request was made and if the tests were successful it would merge it to the branch specified

## Where in the config do you need to go to update the branch?

To access the Jenkins config you would login to Jenkins via (http://3.140.188.113:8080/) find augusta-group-two-CI and click configure. Under source code management (branches to build) you would specify what branch you want it to merge to currently set to 19-ci-pipeline

### Automating Snake Game Deployment using Ansible Playbook and Packer

The Packer AMI step involves using Packer to create Amazon Machine Images (AMI's) of the App machine. Ansible is needed as the provisioning step for Packer build.

#### packer.json

Specifies the AWS access key and secret key as variables. The builder section specifies the type of builder to use (in this case, Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)), the AWS region, the source AMI to use, the instance type, the SSH username, and the name of the AMI to create.

The provisioner section specifies that Ansible should be used to provision the machine, and the app.yml file contains the Ansible playbook for provisioning

#### app.yml

Contains the Ansible playbook for deploying the Snake Game on a server. The playbook is executed on all hosts and requires root access, which is achieved using the `become` and `become_user` parameters.

#### Tasks

    - updates the server packages
    -  installs Nginx
    - creates a directory for the game files
    -  creates a server block in Nginx
    - copies the game files to the server
    -  runs a shell script to update the Nginx configuration file with the server's IP address
    - formats the shell script, runs it, and restarts the Nginx service.
