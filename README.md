## How have you use Jenkins to add Continuous integration with this project?

I have built a test environment in Jenkins that will run the tests and catch any errors with the code and if everything is fine it will be pushed to 
the branch that is specified in the Jenkins configuration.

### How did you allow Jenkins access to the Github repo?

In the Jenkins configuration I ticked the Github project box and pasted the Github Url of where i want the changes to be pushed (currently test-brach but will change to main later)

### How did you get the Github repo to trigger the build?

Using the private ssh key generated by using the command "Ssh-keygen -t rsa" and had to add it to Github,
Added a GitHub webhook with the Jenkins url that was triggered when a push request was made and if the tests were successful it would merge it to the branch specified
